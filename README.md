# Quizzinator
Quizzinator is an app that people can use to create quizzes and also do the actual quizzes. It works on both the web and mobile. The main aim of this project is to learn concepts in Vue and concepts in Supabase.

The web app has been created using [Vue](https://vuejs.org), a single page aplication framework.
The mobile app has been created using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and will be available for both android and iOS.
For the backend, [supabase](https://supabase.com) is used.
